## (help needed! willing to work with anyone)
A powerful GUI application for converting custom ROMs to OPPO's OZIP format, enabling flashing of custom firmware on OPPO/Realme devices using the official recovery system.
(BETA) OZIP tool for Custom ROM for devices without fastboot, No SP Flash tool,  for Oppo, Oneplus, Xiaomi, Realme
![Alt text](/image.png)

compiled using pyinstaller --onefile --windowed aop.py
MUST HAVE PYTHON!

### Basic Conversion

1. **Select Original OZIP**: Choose the official OPPO firmware file (.ozip)
2. **Select Custom system.img**: Choose your custom system image
3. **Choose Output Directory**: Select where to save the converted file
4. **Click Compile**: Start the conversion process

### Conversion Process

The tool performs the following steps automatically:

1. **Decryption**: Decrypts the original OZIP using the appropriate AES key
2. **Extraction**: Extracts the decrypted ZIP contents
3. **Decompression**: Decompresses system.new.dat.br to system.new.dat
4. **Conversion**: Converts system.new.dat to system.img for analysis
5. **Replacement**: Replaces the system image with your custom version
6. **Compression**: Compresses the new system image back to .br format
7. **Re-encryption**: Creates a new OZIP file with your custom ROM

After conversion:
1. Transfer the .ozip file to your phone's storage
2. Shutdown the phone completely
3. Press Power + Volume Down to enter recovery mode
4. Select "Firmware restore from device"
5. Choose your converted .ozip file

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"OPPOENCRYPT! header not found"**
   - Ensure you're using a valid OPPO OZIP file
   - Try the analysis tool first: `python analyze_ozip.py your_file.ozip`

2. **File access errors on Windows**
   - Run as Administrator if needed
   - Check antivirus software isn't blocking file operations
   - Ensure sufficient disk space

3. **Conversion fails at decryption**
   - Your device might use a key not in the database
   - Contact developers to add support for your device

## ü§ù Contributing
want to see this as a application the world can use to flash custom roms for devices with a locked down fastboot, using OEM recovery mode where allowed from device

To add support for a new device:

1. Extract the AES key from your device's recovery
2. Add it to the `KEYS` list in the code
3. Test with your device's OZIP files
4. Submit a pull request
